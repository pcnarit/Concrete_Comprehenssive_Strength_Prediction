# **Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction**

## **Project Description**
This project aims to predict the **compressive strength of concrete** using its age and mixture components through **machine learning**. Concrete compressive strength is a critical property in civil engineering and depends on a highly nonlinear relationship with the material's ingredients and curing age. The goal is to build and evaluate a regression model to accurately predict this strength, providing valuable insights for structural engineering applications.
