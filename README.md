# Concrete_Comprehenssive_Strength_Prediction
Project Description
This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete using its age and mixture components through machine learning. Concrete compressive strength is a critical property in civil engineering and depends on a highly nonlinear relationship with the material's ingredients and curing age. The goal is to build and evaluate a regression model to accurately predict this strength, providing valuable insights for structural engineering applications.
